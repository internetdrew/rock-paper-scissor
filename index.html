    #Pseudo code Create a function that represents the computer player. The
    computer player will randomly return either rock, paper, or scissor. Create
    a user prompt to that lets you easily choose which (rock, paper, scissors)
    you would like to play. Make this input case insensitive. Create logic of
    paper > rock > scissors > paper Create a function that takes user input and
    plays it against computer random selection. This function will be how we
    define a round of play. Write a function called 'game', which will run for 5
    rounds. Create a loop to increment scoring for both sides. Return a
    declaration of the winner.
